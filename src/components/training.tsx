        <p>
          I attended University of Phoenix Online (USA) from 2009 to 2013 and
          received my Associate of Arts and Bachelor in Science degrees, both in
          Information Technologies, with a focus on Web Design and Web
          Development, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, I began studying at Sankta Maria Fölkhogskola in Malmö,
          Sweden with the same focus.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I have attended these schools, I began learning web design on my
          own prior, by looking at the code and figuring out how to do things
          “the hard way”. I learned how to do much of HTML and CSS by trial and
          error. By the time that I attended UoP, I was already familiar with
          the coursework and learned very little. The same could be said with
          attending Sakta Maria; I went in with the knowledge of web design
          already at hand, but wanted to refresh my skills with the newest
          techniques as well as learn a few things that I hadn’t along the way
          (such as JavaScript and React).
        </p>
