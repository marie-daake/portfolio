        <p>
          My name is Marie Daake, and I taught myself everything I know about
          art, desktop publishing, and much of the web design skills I have. I
          started drawing in earnest when I was in 7th grade (about 13 years
          old), and have been working hard to improve my skills since.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still tend to draw on paper when I have the availability, though
          have moved toward digital art as my primary focus. I have a Wacom
          tablet (Intuos) as my main drawing platform on my PC (with Paint Tools
          SAI), as well as a Samsung Galaxy S8 Ultra tablet that I use on-the-go
          (with the app sketchbook). My vectoring is done in Inkscape,
          primarily, though occasionally I use a few other programs to help me
          out when needs be.
        </p>
        <p>
          I program websites in Visual Studio Code. I can do CSS, HTML5, some
          JavaScript and a little PHP, though, I don't know much coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          I design desktop publishing (business cards, letterheads, etc) in a
          combination of programs, including SAI, Inkscape, and MS Publisher.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please feel free to read more about my education, and look through my
          various portfolios, as well as contact me.
